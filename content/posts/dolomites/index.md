title: Dolomites
subTitle: Backpacking with a 2 year old

---
Mountains were always calling, but it not easy to backpack in the wilderness with a baby. All that gear, diapers, baby food, and a baby on our backs....

When we heard about hiking up the mountains, sleeping in refugios that serve wine and food, our eyes widened. Before we knew it, we were on a flight to SF to get our schengen visa. We did all sorts of steep hikes in the pacific northwest. We were ready!!

> Pro Tip: September is a great time to visit the dolomites. With the summer heat gone and  crowds back to work. Book your refugios in advance. We used an agency [Dolomite Mountains](https://www.dolomitemountains.com/en/home.htm) for the convinience. But you could also save some money and book each of the refugios individually.

#### Day 1 - Lago Di Braies to Rifugio Fodara Vedla (7 miles. 1261 m Ascent/643 m Descent)
If you can stay at Lago Di Braies, you should. The beautiful alpine lake admist the soaring Dolomite peaks can only be described as magical.

  The dolomites is a rocky mountain. I cannot insist enough on sturdy boots and hiking poles. It is steep, rocky and lots of scrambles. We did the [Alta Via 1](http://rifugios.net/alta-via-1.html) which does not have any rock scaling, but even so it was very very steep.

After the initial steepness and scramble (which if you ask me is quite unforgiving for the start of a 7 day hike) a cold beer, and sandwiches made us feel whole again.

Even after lunch, it was a long hike to reach the refugio for the night. Albeit, much more gradual it was still a long way to our beds.

#### Day 2 - Altopiano di Fanes (6 miles, 730 m Ascent/815m Descent)
We were surrounded by tall dolomiti rocks that made for spectacular views. 

After a steady climb, we walked along the water's edge of Ru d'Al Plan. The rest of the gang joined us on today. Fannes, had a sand pit and some amazing house wine. Nirvana, for the young and old alike!

I wish I had an extra day to laze around the river and taking in the mountain views.

#### Day 3 - Rifugio Lagazuoi (6 miles, 730 m Ascent/815m Descent)
Ouch! The views were spectacular. But to describe the climb - I think Ouch is more appropriate.

After some dramatic climbs, and a steep descent we breaked for some packed lunch. You could hike further down to a beautiful green lake - Lago di Limo. But my feet needed a break so we just lazed around for lunch. 

A few ups and downs later, we reached a long steady climb to Lagazuoi. As we climed up, we  came across World War 1 bunkers used by the Austrian's during the war. 

At about 1.5 miles to the Refugio it started  hailing on us, and we took refuge at a World war 1 bunker. It was the real deal with a stone bed,and an old table inside.

#### Day 4 - Passo Giau (10.9 miles, 1103m Ascent/1541m Descent)
Sunrise at Lagazuoi was phenomenal. We took the cable car down to skip the steep upclimb we did the previous day.

The rest of the day had its own share of meadows,and a lot of up and down.

Nestled in between mountains, the Passo Giau has amazing views. The place is accessible by a road. So even if you are driving through the dolomites, do visit.

 ** Day 5 - Passo Staulanza (9.3 miles, 530m ascent/1000m descent)
 After some croissants and cakes for breakfast. We trodged om, the hike to staulanza was beautiful and gentle. Lush meadows, and inspiring mountain views lead into a light wooded trail.

 ** Day 6 - Tissi (6.7 miles 1130m ascent/644m descent)
 More cakes for breakfast, we were running late today and it was a hard hike, so we took milk to go! We hiked by several farms around tall organ shaped mountains. Towards mid-day we reached the green waters of lago coldai.

 The last stretch to Tissi was so brutal, it was all the uphill for the day put together in a single brutal stretch. But we did make it, the folks at the refugio were packing up for the season, so we had 2 dorms instead of one. We needed the sleeping sheets we had packed up for our stay here(this was the only place we needed it). The views from Tissi was from another world

 The views from Tissi was from another world. You could walk up to edge of the mountains, and see the dolomites in all its splendour

 ** Day 7 Capanna Trieste (6 miles, )
 It was going to rain today, so we took the easy hike down out. It was a steady steep way down. A long hike on the road, and we finally reached the end of a 7 day hike!

	 We called a taxi and drove back to Cortina.
